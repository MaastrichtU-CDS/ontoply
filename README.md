# Ontologies

This repo shows how to extract subsets of ontologies, which is particularly 
useful when you are working with big ontologies, but do not need all 
concepts from it.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.8 or higher

## How to use

Have a look at `main.py` for examples on how to use the code. The script 
assumes that you downloaded the 
[NCIT ontology](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/NCIT?p=summary) 
in RDF/XML format and saved it in a directory called `ontologies` under the 
name `ncit.owl`.
